# Requirements

To try and encourage more sales of the 5 different Harry Potter books they sell, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts of multiple-book purchases. They use the following pricing strategy:

- One copy of any of the five books costs £8.
- If you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.
- If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.
- If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.
- If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 25% discount.

> Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which only 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs £8.

The mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only Harry Potter books), giving as big a discount as possible.
